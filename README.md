## Application Purpose and Use

This application serves as a password manager, designed to securely store and manage users' login credentials for various platforms. It offers functionalities such as user registration and login, password generation, adding new platform accounts, and listing all stored platform accounts. The application employs a simple yet effective encryption method for safeguarding the passwords stored within it.

## How It Works

Users are presented with a primary menu when they run the application, which includes options to log in, register a new user, remove an existing user, and exit the program. Users can create strong passwords, list all of their saved accounts, and add new platform accounts after logging in. Sensitive information is kept safe by encrypting and decrypting passwords using an XOR encryption technique for storage and access.

## Instructions for Using the Application

1. **Open the Application:** The main menu will appear when you launch the application.

2. **Register/Login:** Select whether to use your current login information or to register as a new user.

3. **Manage Accounts:** Using the user menu, create a strong password, display current accounts, and add new platform accounts after logging in.

4. **Logout/Quit:** To log out, navigate back to the main menu. Alternatively, utilise the user menu to end the application immediately.
